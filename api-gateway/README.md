# API Gateway examples

An API gateway is programming that sits in front of an application programming interface (API) and acts as a single point of entry for a defined group of microservices.

In addition to exposing microservices, popular API gateway features include functions such as:

- authentication
- security policy enforcement
- load balancing
- cache management
- dependency resolution
- contract and service level agreement (SLA) management

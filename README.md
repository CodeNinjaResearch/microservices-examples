# Microservices examples

**This repository contains examples which applied micro-services architecture and design patterns**

[Microservices](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, which implement business capabilities. 

The microservice architecture enables the continuous delivery/deployment of large, complex applications. It also enables an organization to evolve its technology stack.
